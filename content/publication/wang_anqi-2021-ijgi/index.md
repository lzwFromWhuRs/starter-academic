abstract: Along with the increase of big data and the advancement of technologies, comprehensive data-driven knowledge of urban systems is becoming more attainable, yet the connection between big-data research and its application e.g., in smart city development, is not clearly articulated. Focusing on Human Mobility, one of the most frequently investigated applications of big data analytics, a framework for linking international academic research and city-level management policy was established and applied to the case of Hong Kong. Literature regarding human mobility research using big data are reviewed. These studies contribute to (1) discovering the spatial-temporal phenomenon, (2) identifying the difference in human behaviour or spatial attributes, (3) explaining the dynamic of mobility, and (4) applying to city management. Then, the application of the research to smart city development are scrutinised based on email queries to various governmental departments in Hong Kong. The identified challenges include data isolation, data unavailability, gaming between costs and quality of data, limited knowledge derived from rich data, as well as estrangement between public and private sectors. With further improvement in the practical value of data analytics and the utilization of data sourced from multiple sectors, paths to achieve smarter cities from policymaking perspectives are highlighted.Volunteered geographic information can be used to predict regional desirability. A common challenge regarding previous works is that intuitive empirical models, which are inaccurate and bring in perceptual bias, are traditionally used to predict regional desirability. This results from the fact that the hidden interactions between user online check-ins and regional desirability haven’t been revealed and clearly modelled yet. To solve the problem, a novel neural network model ‘RegNet’ is proposed. The user check-in history is input into a neural network encoder structure firstly for redundancy reduction and feature learning. The encoded representation is then fed into a hidden-layer structure and the regional desirability is predicted. The proposed RegNet is data-driven and can adaptively model the unknown mappings from input to output, without presumed bias and prior knowledge. We conduct experiments with real-world datasets and demonstrate RegNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of ranking quality and prediction accuracy of rating. Additionally, we also examine how the structure of encoder affects RegNet performance and suggest on choosing proper sizes of encoded representation. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven methods in modelling the hidden unknown relationships and achieving a better performance over traditional empirical methods.
