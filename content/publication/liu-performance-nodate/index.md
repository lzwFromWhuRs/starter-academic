abstract: Various methods have been proposed to detect individual origins with geo-tagged social media. However, a common challenge regarding origin detection methods (ODMs) is that, due to the rare availability of ground truth, accuracies and robustness of ODMs haven’t been evaluated yet, undermining the reliability of relevant research. To address this challenge, in this work, we collect users’ real information from unstructured online content, and evaluate performances and robustness of ODMs at individual level. ODMs are evaluated in terms of two tasks:origin detection and differentiating local/tourist. Our results show ODMs achieve high accuracies in origin detection but may overestimate the number of tourists, bringing bias into results. Robustness analysis shows ODMs’ performances are affected by the degree of user activity and count of countries that user has visited, while insensitive to user gender. For temporal sensitivity, ODMs perform better over weekends and summertime than other periods, but the best performances are achieved with datasets covering whole time periods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that performances and robustness of ODMs are evaluated at individual level. Valuable information can be obtained by knowing accuracies/bias of ODMs and how to achieve better performance with proper experiment settings.
